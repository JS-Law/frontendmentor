## My process
First I knew I had to tackle the responsive design. I started with the desktop version first and gradually laid out the elements according to their position in the design preview. Once I had the layout right, I began styling and tweaking the margins until everything looked right. The real trouble was figuring out a way to call upon a different image when the breakpoint demanded it. I knew I couldnt use HTML to conditionally choose which image to display so I looked to CSS. Once I knew they BOTH had to be 'displayed' at the same time, everything got a bit easier, setting the visibility to none on the image I didnt want to be displayed was the real moment I felt like I could see the finish line.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media queries
### What I learned

I learned a great deal about responsive development during the process of making this. When I first started this project, I was worried I had bitten off more than I could chew. Regardless, I started the project and knew I had to learn more about media queries to get this project to finish line. I'm proud of the whole design. I think I solidified what I had known already and in the process I picked up a few new skills to add to my toolbox.

### Continued development

I cant wait to utilize media queries in my future projects. I truly feel like a door has opened and that what I can create has grown exponentially with the completion of it.
### Useful resources

The only resource I used was media query documentation.
